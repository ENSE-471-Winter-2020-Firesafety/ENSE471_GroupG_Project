When using this tool, it is important to note that both firefighters and children may use it.

Firefighters may leverage the "what to expect" button, 
to get an idea for what script the child is preparing to hear

Its perfectly okay to say your own version, as firefighters are an authority on the matter.
However, it will be useful to know the script is there.





Usage of the tool for children is quite easy. Ensure they start at the home page - do not let them navigate 
with the web address bar.

Children will click 911 when they wish to start. They will be instructed by the supervisor to dial 911.
Children have unlimited tries, but for each set of 3 failed attempts, will be given further guidance. 

Sucessfully dialing 911 will redirect to a mock-up call session. The supervisor is now encouraged to 
pretend with the child, and go through the script or some variation.

Once finished, encourage the child to hang up. The hang up button will redirect to a celebratory end page.

From there, a child may leave the phone, quit, go to home, close the app etc. They are done. The teacher may
now reclaim the phone for the next student's turn.
