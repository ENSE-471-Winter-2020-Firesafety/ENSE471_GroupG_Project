While you can install this to any device(s), the easiest way for a large deployment is to 
host the webpage on a domain or server - which grants greater accesibility. 
Really, we want anything easily accecible by your staff from the web.

For example, everyone can demo the tool at 
http://hzyone.com/home/
Or
http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~lane203m/call911_471/home/index.html

The above works without installing anything. 
So, consider hosting it to avoid distributing multiple copies. 



If you simply wish to install this to a device, like a personal computer/phone - do the following:

download a copy of our repository, specifically the src folder. It can be downloaded anywhere you like.

Extract the contents if they are compressed. 

You have now downloaded the tool. To run it, open the source folder and double click run.html
You may also navigate to src/home/index.html for the same effect.




If you would prefer to host this on a domain, 
you will need to add the src folder to your server and redirect to index.html by some means.
Or, set home as your root folder/landing page.
